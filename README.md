CM11 for Nubia Z7 Max

This is CM11 for the Nubia Z7 Max Phone. I have operated it for 1 month
with no crashes. Prior to loading cm11 code it is advisable to Apply
both Nubia.cn updates 1.29 and 1.38 to the phone as BOTH update the
radios.  The radios were not flashed properly at the factory in most
cases. Once these updates have been applied the you can wipe phone data
areas and apply cm11_NX505J_1.0 If you don't update radios may only get
2G in some cases and not 3G or H+ Also note per Nubia firmware notes,
only one 3G or 4 G LTE connection can exist at one time. Specify in
|Settings|MultiSIM| in cm11 which card has current data connection. In
|Settings|MobileNetworks| you need to set one card as GSM only or CDMA
only and the other can have 3G or H+ or LTE. So far I have had these
settings work fine:

Verizon CDMA only voice with
T-Mobile GSM/WCDMA/LTE Voice/Data

ATT GSM only voice with
T-Mobile GSM/WCDMA/LTE Voice/Data

T-Mobile GSM only voice with
ATT GSM/WCDMA/LTE Voice/Data
