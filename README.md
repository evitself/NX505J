CM11 for Nubia Z7 Max

This is CM11 for the Nubia Z7 Max Phone. It has been well tested including operating it for 1 month
with no crashes. It is the original work of the master ROM compiler lwang. http://weibo.com/lwanggg
developer credits going out to to syhostï¼Œzhaochengw.  And credits to GeorgeDavey for setting
up this GitHub project to flow rapidly into a hopefully official CM soon. We will be presenting the device
tree configuration as well as the kernel repository just as soon as these lastest issues are resolved. 

Prior to loading cm11 ROM into Nubia Z7 Max it is most advisable to Apply
both Nubia.cn updates 1.29 and 1.38 to the phone as BOTH update the
radios.  The radios were not flashed properly at the factory in most
cases. If you don't update radios software you may only get
2G in some cases and not 3G, H or H+.
Also note per Nubia.cn firmware documentation notes,
only one 3G or 4 G LTE connection can exist at one time. Specify in
|Settings|MultiSIM| in cm11 which card has current data connection. In
|Settings|MobileNetworks| you need to set one card as GSM only or CDMA
only and the other can have 3G or H+ or LTE. So far I have had these
settings work fine:

Verizon CDMA only voice with
T-Mobile GSM/WCDMA/LTE Voice/Data also with ATT or Cricket Data 2G.
*
ATT GSM only voice with
T-Mobile GSM/WCDMA/LTE Voice/Data also with ATT, Walmart, Cricket Data at H, H+, 3G
*
T-Mobile GSM only voice with
ATT GSM/WCDMA/LTE Voice/Data also with T-Mobile, Walmart, Cricket Data at H, H+, 3G
*
More are possible but I only have a limited number of carrier and SIM for test. Also Verizon Test
completed before last radio software update so I need to repeat.

Once these Nubia.cn updates have been applied the you can wipe phone data
areas using CWM v6.0.5.0 and apply cm11_NX505J_2.0 posted here.  Don't forget CM not
permitted to include some Google Applications.  You should insall gapps.zip
If you need the Google Applications mentioned above.  Check the wiki for rooting
help with the Nubia Z7 Max and some help with loading CM11. Please don't break your phone
If you need help bring it to a person who knows SU, CWM and CM.
